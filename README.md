# LinkUp
LinkUp is meant to assist golfers in coordinating tee times with friends by providing relevant weather data, a platform for creating and joining tee times, and a platform for scoring matches. It also incorporates messaging to other users as well as friend connections in order to provide the user with only the potential matches that interest them.

# Description
A platform for scheduling tee times with friends and keeping score on the course. Users have the option to create tee times, add friends, message others, and add new courses to the database via the course form where Google maps will have already provided the courses nearby. Once a user has created a tee time, weather data down to the hour will automatically populate on the tee time listing. The tee time will also show up on the homepage calendar so tee times are never missed. Any other users that have added the host user as friends can then join the created tee time with a single click. On the day of the match, users can keep score and make notes about their play via LinkUp's scoring platform. After the match, the scorecard for the completed game will be archived and viewable from the profiles of any user that participated.
